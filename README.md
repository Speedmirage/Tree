# What this Program does?

This program is able to print out the word "Temparature" form an out-of order state. This is done by utilizing trees, and reading them using pre-order traversal. 

## How to run it?

Since this program requires multiple files to run; It wasnâ€™t able to run on a cloud based compiler. Therefore, you can find all the necessary files [here](https://github.com/Speedmirage/Tree). Lastly, if you are using Xcode an Xcode project was included for your convinience :)
